# **App Name**: Hallway

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure authentication for admins, supervisors, HODs (CSE, CSE-AIML, CSD, IT, ECE, EEE), TPO cell, college management, and clubs (E-Cell, NSS, NCC).
- Real-time Hall Availability: Display real-time availability of seminar halls: CV Raman Hall, Newton Hall, Hall 3, Hall 4.
- Booking Request Submission: Allow authenticated users to submit hall booking requests with event details.
- Priority-Based Conflict Resolution: Implement a priority system (TPO > College Management > HODs > Clubs) to resolve booking conflicts. In the event of a clash, use an AI tool to find and suggest alternative times or halls based on event details and user priority. The AI tool helps the admin make an informed and fair final decision.
- Approval Workflow: Route booking requests to college management for approval.
- Automated Invoice Generation: Generate a PDF invoice with hall details, digital signatures (Principal, College Management), and a QR code linking to event details.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin dashboard to manage halls, users, booking requests, and priority settings.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to convey professionalism and reliability, fitting for an administrative tool.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated teal (#F0FFFF) for a clean and calming interface.
- Accent color: Muted cyan (#70D1D1) for interactive elements and calls to action, ensuring they stand out without disrupting the overall aesthetic.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings to give a techy feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to make the text easier to read.
- Use clear, consistent icons to represent hall availability, user roles, and event types.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Implement subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as booking confirmations and status updates.
