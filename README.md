📘 Project Overview
🔹 Problem Statement

In colleges, multiple events—seminars, workshops, placement drives, and meetings—occur daily in seminar halls. Managing these hall bookings manually leads to conflicts, miscommunication, and scheduling overlaps.

🔹 Solution

This project introduces a real-time web-based seminar hall booking system that allows authorized users (HODs, TPO, College Management, Clubs, etc.) to check hall availability, request bookings, and get automated approvals.
The system uses Firebase backend and AI-based logic for conflict resolution and intelligent suggestions.

🧩 Key Features

User Authentication — Secure access for Admins, Supervisors, HODs (CSE, CSE-AIML, CSD, IT, ECE, EEE), TPO, Management, and Clubs (E-Cell, NSS, NCC).

Real-time Hall Availability — View instant availability of:

CV Raman Hall

Newton Hall

Abdul Kalam Hall

Visvesvaraya Hall

Booking Request System — Submit hall booking requests with event details.

Priority-Based Conflict Resolution — Automated AI logic prioritizes bookings:

TPO > College Management > HODs > Clubs

Approval Workflow — Requests are routed to college management for review.

Admin Dashboard — Manage halls, users, bookings, and system settings.

Responsive UI — Built for smooth access on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
